I signed up for [Boingo](http://www.boingo.com/) a few months ago and loved the service. I could easily pull out my laptop, work at any airport I wanted, and save myself a few hours of work when I get home. Everything was great, I couldn't be happier, we were a happy new couple. Unfortunately, a cruel mistress came between us and broke us up - the iPad!

(That's not entirely true, I also broke up with Boingo because their service at the Atlanta airport is awful!)

The iPad is an amazing travel companion. It fits those moments when your phone isn't enough, but your laptop is too cumbersome and big - this describes just about the whole travel process from moving around the airport to sitting in the plane. I can watch movies, read a book or the news, and listen to my music and podcasts all without taking up even half of my tray table. For all of those people that don't get where the iPad fits in this world, this is it!

So of course, the iPad isn't a laptop replacement. I sometimes bring my iPad and sometimes my laptop when I go out or travel. Seems reasonable, right? Why should I bring both if I only plan on using one? Apparently Boingo disagrees with me. They want to charge your usage per device. Not even how many devices are connected, which would make sense, but they want to charge me extra for wanting to use another device. Sure, they'll let me use 2 laptops under the cheap $9.95 plan, but a laptop and an iPad? That'll be $17.90, thank you! That means I'm charging double regardless of if I plan to use twice as much data (the only metric they should care about).

The purpose of the iPad is to have a convenient alternative to a laptop. When would I ever be using them both together? Never! Unfortunately, until companies realize the true use of the iPad, we'll see more bizarre marketing and billing from companies like Boingo.

Too bad, I liked you at first, Boingo...
