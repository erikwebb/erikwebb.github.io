I recently began working at [Acquia](http://www.acquia.com) as a traveling consultant spreading the Drupal word. I've so far loved every second of it! I tackle different problems with different people in different cities every week. This is the most challenging job I've ever had and I'm thrilled to be in such a wonderful place. So far, I've flown almost 8,000 miles in 6 weeks! Not to mention probably another 500 miles of driving and the "cost" of staying in hotels every week.

This has recently created an awful conflict in my mind. I honestly believe I have found the job that best suits every one of my skills and is absolutely perfect for me at this phase of my life. On the other hand, my gut tells me this much travel is not kosher in the world. Recently I have been doing my best to stay in hotels walking distance to work, using a car only a few times during the week (if at all), and avoiding my impact as much as possible while I'm there. I still feel helpless knowing that my travels in this new job has escalated my carbon footprint significantly.

[The Nature Conservancy](http://www.nature.org/) has done an excellent job in creating an easy-to-understand guide to quantifying your carbon offsets. Their [GoZero program](http://www.conservationfund.org/gozero) has been adopted by many travel companies including Delta, my airline of choice/convenience. For the longest time, I've always ignored the little contributions that I can make for each trip. A few days ago I was looking at my SkyMiles account and realized how many flights I've taken in the past 6 weeks and it caught me off-guard for some reason. I think I've been so happy in the moment of starting this new job and getting involved, that I've checked some of my ideals at the door. Not that this job has taken this away from me, but I've instead allowed myself to think distraction is an acceptable excuse.

From this point on, I am going to make sure to at least purchase these offsets and cancel out net impact. I think this is something that should become part of every business practice to sacrifice the fractions of a percentage of revenue for the greater good.
