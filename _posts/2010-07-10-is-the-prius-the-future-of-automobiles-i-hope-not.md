Working in Philadelphia this week, I rented a 2010 Toyota Prius. I flew in on July 5th and they had practically no cars available from the July 4th holiday, so they gave me the "key" to a Prius (Note to Hertz: You say it's silver, I say it's pea green. Let's agree to disagree.) Overall, the car was absolutely horrible. To spoil the ending, I got 42mpg total. I can bet a VW/Audi TDI can easily beat that in an enjoyable experience for similar money (at least in VW's case). From now on, it'll be a Ford Focus or Fusion wherever I go (thank you, Budget).

### Joystick gearshift, seriously? ###

The gearshift on the Prius is literally a joystick. You move it to the correct gear (D, N, R, etc.), hold it for a second, then let go and it returns to its original position. That's right, your car is in drive, but you look at the gearshift and it's not on D. That's takes some serious getting used to. Several times I thought I had taken the car out of D without even noticing. Oh, and did I mention that P is a separate button, not on the gearshift, so you can be in drive, then press a button and go straight to P?

### It's quiet in a parking lotâ€¦ ###

There's a lot of discussion about how quiet hybrids are in general. When driving in parking lots and around town, they make very little noise, which is truly nice. On the other hand, if you take a hard step on the gas, the poor, little Prius makes a ridiculous whirring noise that makes you think the batteries are releasing all of their charge directly into your ear. I may get used to it over time, but in today's world, that's a very uncomforting noise to hear coming from your car.

### Worst spoiler design ever! ###

The spoiler/scoop/fin that runs horizontally across the back of the Prius probably provides somewhat better downforce. Beyond that, the design couldn't be worse. The spoiler angles up to block the most air. When you look back out the rear window, it blocks a good 8 inches right in the middle of the back window. But wait, there's more! The top half is not tinted, the bottom half is. That's right, you look back and see two completely different shades of everything. This makes headlights look absolutely bizarre. It turns every headlight into an SUV's headlight, because all you can see is the top half. I simply don't get the tinting. Either tint it or don't!

### You pay just for the electricity ###

The interior of the car is absolutely atrocious. Anything you see that has cloth over it, likely has zero padding and has the hardest possible plastic underneath. The armrests are legitimately painful. There is no instrument panel, just a small screen under the windshield wipers. Maybe this is a good design to keep it closer to the windshield, but it is different than every other car out there (Mini somewhat included). The novelty of the quality hybrid system is nice, but it's exactly what you pay for. A Ford Focus has much better cabin quality. Hell, a Dodge Caliber has better fit and finish. I don't care if it's a hybrid, it shouldn't feel like a <$10k car inside.

### So what was good? ###

 - Gas mileage - averaged 42 mpg over the week
 - Nice, pretty display with your energy consumption and rear backup camera
 - Acceleration is not as bad as I expected at all
 - Gas mileage?
