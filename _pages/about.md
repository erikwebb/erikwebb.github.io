Erik is a Technical Team Lead in Acquia's Professional Services organization, where he has worked since early 2010. First introduced to and developing in Drupal in 2007, Erik continues to leverage his extensive experience with Drupal, enterprise PHP application development, and Red Hat systems engineering, by working with many of the largest Drupal users in the world. Since joining Acquia, Erik has advised well over 100 clients, including large Public Sector clients in state and national government and many Fortune 500 companies, in the design of their architecture and in improving their critically important performance and scalability.

Erik conducts Infrastructure, Full Application, and Performance audits through a quantitative, process-oriented approach to guarantee high-impact, measurable results. Equally comfortable with low-level hosting issues and modern development methodologies, Erik brings a unique skill set that can fully address the entire needs of a Drupal project, from top to bottom.

Prior to joining Acquia, Erik spent the better part of a decade working in higher education as a Systems Administrator at Georgia Tech, concentrating on automation and deployment in computation-intensive environments. In addition he brings years of experience as an enterprise web applications developer and architect at IBM. He currently lives and works out of Atlanta, GA.
